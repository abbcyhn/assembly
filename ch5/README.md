## Chapter 5. Dealing with Files: Use the Concepts

- Create toupper program: [toupper.s](toupper.s)

- Modify the toupper program so that it reads from STDIN and writes to STDOUT instead of using the files on the command-line.

- Change the size of the buffer.

- Rewrite the program so that it uses storage in the .bss section rather than the stack to store the file descriptors.

- Write a program that will create a file called heynow.txt and write the words "Hey diddle diddle!" into it.
